# Dashboard

**Route:** `/`  
**Primary files:** `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`, widgets under `client/src/components/dashboard/`

## Purpose

A **configurable workspace** of resizable panels. Users add, remove, resize, and
configure dashboard widgets. Layout is persisted per user per instance via Convex
(`dashboardLayouts`).

## Behavior

- **Widget registry** (`client/src/lib/dashboard-widgets/registry.ts`) is an explicit
  hand-written list mapping a stable `type` key to a React component, grouped into
  `stream` / `automation` / `utility` categories. Unknown types render an "Unknown
  widget type" fallback rather than crashing, so renaming a `type` orphans existing
  placements.
- **Layout** is chosen per panel from `client/src/lib/dashboard-layouts.ts`. Zone ids
  are positional (`${rowIndex}-${columnIndex}`); a zone can hold several stacked,
  resizable widgets, each identified by `slotId`.
- **Persistence** has two paths. Placement edits (add, remove, resize) are held in
  local draft state while edit mode is on and written by `setPanelWidgets` on Save,
  so Cancel needs no server round-trip. A widget changing **its own config** outside
  edit mode writes through immediately — otherwise the change would be dropped.
  Note this covers a widget's *settings*, which are per user along with the layout
  row they live in. Content that belongs to the channel rather than the viewer —
  macros, stream goals — lives in its own instance-scoped table instead.

## Widgets

| Type | Category | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `stream-status` | stream | Live/offline, viewers, uptime |
| `live-events` | stream | Follows/subs/cheers/raids direct from Twitch |
| `activity` | stream | Tabbed events, pinned notes, highlights |
| `stream-preview` | stream | Thumbnail, click to enlarge |
| `broadcast-controls` | stream | Announcement and shoutout |
| `workflow-runs` | automation | Recent and in-progress executions |
| `macro-pad` | automation | One-click buttons — see below |
| `stream-stats` | utility | Viewers, uptime, category |
| `notes` | utility | Per-stream scratch pad |

## Macro pad

Square buttons that fire a chat command, a workflow, or an HTTP request. Its own
edit mode (distinct from the dashboard's) enables drag-to-reorder via dnd-kit plus
per-button edit and delete.

**There is one macro pad per instance, and it is shared.** The buttons and their
order both live in the `macros` table (`convex/macros.ts`), not in the widget's
config — the same reasoning as `streamGoals`: a dashboard layout is a personal
workspace preference, but the macro pad is the channel's, so everyone sharing the
account sees the same buttons in the same order. Placing the widget on two panels
shows the same pad in both.

One row per macro, not an array on a parent document: add, edit and delete each
touch a single document, and a reorder writes `sortOrder` only on the rows that
moved, so two people editing the pad cannot clobber each other. Reorder is applied
through a Convex optimistic update so a dragged tile does not spring back while
the round-trip completes.

Each button carries an optional Lucide **icon** and **color**. Color is stored as
six-digit hex (`#rrggbb`) — chosen from preset swatches or the native picker — and
tints the tile's border, icon, and a faint `${hex}20` background wash, the same
treatment the module detail panel gives catalog colors. The label keeps the theme
foreground so any choice stays readable.

Buttons support **variables**: any `{{name}}` written into the command, URL, body,
or a header value is collected from the user in a prompt before the macro runs.
The `{{…}}` delimiter is deliberately distinct from the workflow engine's `${…}`
and the shared TS resolver's `{…}` (see `client/src/lib/macro-pad.ts` for why) —
variable names are restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.

Execution of `chat-command` and `trigger-workflow` is **not yet wired** to the
engine; both log to the console. `http-request` currently fetches straight from the
browser, so it is subject to CORS and exposes any header secret client-side.

## Data sources

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Layout and widget config | Convex (`dashboardLayouts`) |
| Per-widget data | Each widget owns its own Convex query/action — see the widget file |
